JumpCut: Non-Successive Mask Transfer and Interpolation for Video Cutout
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Note

Our dataset contains 5 subsets, which are ANIMAL, HUMAN, STATIC, SNAPCUT and FAST. It totally contains 22 image sequences with its ground truth segmented by our own. To take a brief look at the dataset, please check Figure 4 in our paper.

We are really thankful that Xue Bai provides some image sequences of his SnapCut paper[1] for us to test. These image sequences are included in the SNAPCUT dataset.

Within FAST dataset, there are four sequences downloaded from Youtube with standard Youtube license. They are tricking, supertramp, kongfu and cheetah. For the front three ones (tricking, supertramp and kongfu), we have obtained permission from the authors for free use, but for the last one (cheetah), we don't own the copyright yet. These videos are provided only for non-commercial research purposes.

All the left image sequences are from Zhong et al 2012[2] or free to use.
